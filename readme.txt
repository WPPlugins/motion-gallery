== Frequently Asked Questions ==
  = What parameters should I set up to look good to me the carousel? =
  Once installed and activated, and the default plugin works correctly. The parameters are common to change the folder where you write the server folder containing the images. After adjusting the parameter row, width, height and get to the gallery is good. These parameters are often required to configure either because the gallery is different depending on the images you upload.
